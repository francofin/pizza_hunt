Heroku to host our database in production. Unfortunately, JawsDB only works with MySQL, so we'll need to use MongoDB Atlas instead.
MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service that's created and maintained by MongoDB. 
It works with hosting services such as AWS, Azure, 
and Google Cloud to help users provision, maintain, and secure new databases for their applications.

A cluster is simply a server that allows you to create and maintain multiple MongoDB databases.

The good thing is we already have our database set up with MongoDB Atlas. All we need to do now is
 create an application for Pizza Hunt on Heroku and add our production database connection URI string to it as an environment variable.
